# t= " world"
# a= s+t
# print(a)

# 24. Create a variable a with a value of True (Find out what integer value is behind True. Demonstrate it)

# a = True
# print(int(a))

# 25. Create a variable b with a value of False (Find out what integer value is behind True. Demonstrate it)

# 27. Evaluate the expression 

# a = True
# b = False

# a=1
# b=0

# a = True

# 41. Write a python program that asks the user to enter their name, allows them to enter text,
# and then says hello as follows:


# name = input('Enter your name: ')
# print("Hello", name)

# quest1= (input('Enter First Number:3 '))
# return quest1
# quest2= (input('Enter Second Number:5 '))
# return quest2
# answer = quest1 + quest2
# print(quest1 " plus" quest1 "= " answer)


# num1 = input('Enter first number:3 ')
# num2 = input('Enter second number:5 ')

# # Add two numbers
# sum = float(num1) + float(num2)



# 42. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, the prints the result of adding them.

# Enter First Number: 3
# Enter Second Number: 5
# 3 plus 5 = 8

# print('{0} plus {1} = {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))

# 43. Write program that allows the user to enter some text.
# Display that text in all UPPER CASE


# capitalized_string = input('Enter some text ')
# capitalized_string = capitalize(capitalized_string)


# print( "capitalize")

# a = 5
# if a > 10:
#     print 'a is greater than 10'
#     if a >= 15:
#         print 'a is also at least 15'
# elif a > 5:
#     print 'a is greater than 5 but not greater than 10'
# else:
#     print 'no condition matched'
#     print 'so a is 5 or less'
